Translators: compilers, assemblers and interpreters  Translators are software used by programmers to convert programs from  one language to another. There are three types: compilers, assemblers  and interpreters. At some point, every piece of software, whether it is  application software or system software, has to be written by a programmer.  A program is simply a series of instructions written by a programmer that  the computer’s processor must carry out.  In order to write software, programmers use programming languages which  allow them to write code in a way that is user-friendly for the programmer.  However, the processor will not understand the programmers’ code, so  it has to be translated into machine code, that is, 0s and 1s. Compilers,  assemblers and interpreters are used to carry out this translation process.  There is more detail on how these work in Chapter 29.  Operating system software  An operating system is a collection of software designed to act as an  interface between the user and the computer and manages the overall  operation of the computer. It links together the hardware, the applications  and the user, but hides the true complexity of the computer from the user  and other software – a so-called virtual machine.

Unfortunately this means the computer will not understand any of  the high-level language source code, so it will have to be translated in some  way. This process is called translation and in order to carry it out a special  piece of systems software called a translator is needed.  The assembler is the translator used for low-level languages and there  are two types of translator for high-level languages: an interpreter and a  compiler.  Interpreter  An interpreter works by reading a statement of the source code and  immediately performing the required action. It may do this by interpreting  the syntax of each statement, or by calling predefined routines. In some  cases, the source code is translated into an intermediate format before it  is executed. Interpreters may examine every statement, which can reduce  efficiency. For example, in an iterative statement, the interpreter will read  the same statement once for each iteration.  Typically an interpreter only converts what needs to be translated.  For example when the line of code:  If Age<17 Then Output = \"Cannot drive a car\"  needs to be translated, only the first section of the code If Age<17 Then..."},{"role": "assistant","content": "[\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the general name for any program that translates code from one language to another?\",\n      \"choices\": [\"Translator\", \"Interpreter\", \"Compiler\", \"Assembler\"],\n      \"answer\": [0],\n      \"topics\": [\"Translators\"],\n      \"questionType\": \"Multiple Choice\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Which type of translator works by reading each statement in the source code and immediately performing the action?\",\n      \"choices\": [\"Translator\", \"Interpreter\", \"Compiler\", \"Assembler\"],\n      \"answer\": [1],\n      \"topics\": [\"Translators\"],\n      \"questionType\": \"Multiple Choice\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the purpose of using a compiler?\",\n      \"choices\": [\"To assemble source code\", \"To interpret low-level languages\", \"To translate high-level languages\", \"To execute machine code\"],\n      \"answer\": [2],\n      \"topics\": [\"Translators\"],\n      \"questionType\": \"Multiple Choice\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Which type of translator examines every statement, potentially reducing efficiency?\",\n      \"choices\": [\"Translator\", \"Interpreter\", \"Compiler\", \"Assembler\"],\n      \"answer\": [1],\n      \"topics\": [\"Translators\"],\n      \"questionType\": \"Multiple Choice\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Which type of translator converts source code into machine code?\",\n      \"choices\": [\"Translator\", \"Interpreter\", \"Compiler\", \"Assembler\"],\n      \"answer\": [2],\n      \"topics\": [\"Translators\"],\n      \"questionType\": \"Multiple Choice\"\n    }\n  ]"}]}

Unfortunately this means the computer will not understand any of  the high-level language source code, so it will have to be translated in some  way. This process is called translation and in order to carry it out a special  piece of systems software called a translator is needed.  The assembler is the translator used for low-level languages and there  are two types of translator for high-level languages: an interpreter and a  compiler.  Interpreter  An interpreter works by reading a statement of the source code and  immediately performing the required action. It may do this by interpreting  the syntax of each statement, or by calling predefined routines. In some  cases, the source code is translated into an intermediate format before it  is executed. Interpreters may examine every statement, which can reduce  efficiency. For example, in an iterative statement, the interpreter will read  the same statement once for each iteration.  Typically an interpreter only converts what needs to be translated.
